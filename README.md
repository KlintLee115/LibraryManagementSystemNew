# Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Library Management System, a robust application designed using the .NET MAUI framework with C# as the programming language. This system is tailored to streamline the management of library operations, enhancing both the librarian and member experiences by automating routine tasks.

# Key Features
- Borrow and Return Items: Our system simplifies the process of borrowing and returning books and other library materials. Members can easily check out items using their library card, and return them by the due date. The system automatically updates the inventory and member records accordingly.
- CRUD Operations on Library Items

The core of our system lies in its ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on library items:
  - Create: Librarians can add new books and materials to the system, including details like title, author, ISBN, and publication date.
  - Read: Both members and librarians can search the catalog to find books and other materials. Searches can be performed by title, author, ISBN, and other metadata.
  - Update: Information about library items can be updated as needed. This includes modifying book details, availability status, and other pertinent information.
  - Delete: Items that are no longer available or are obsolete can be removed from the catalog.

# Additional Functionalities
- Account Management: Users can register new accounts, and librarians can manage memberships, including cancellations or suspensions.
- Reservations and Renewals: Members can reserve books that are currently checked out and renew books they are already borrowing.
- Notifications: The system sends automated notifications for overdue items, reservation statuses, and other important alerts.

# Problem Solved
Managing a library involves numerous complex tasks, from tracking book loans to maintaining an up-to-date catalog and managing user memberships. Our Library Management System addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, automated solution that reduces manual work, minimizes errors, and improves the overall efficiency of library operations. It ensures that members have better access to library resources and that librarians can focus more on customer service rather than routine administrative tasks.

# Technologies Used
- .NET MAUI: Used for creating a cross-platform GUI that runs on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS from a single codebase.
- C#: The primary programming language for building the application logic.
- PostgreSQL: For database management, to store and retrieve all library data efficiently.
